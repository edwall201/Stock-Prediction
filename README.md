# AI Stock Prediction and Machine Learning Analysis


## Research Objective
Utilize LSTM models to predict short-term stock price trends.

## Tools Used
- Python
- Pandas
- Numpy
- Matplotlib + Bokeh
- Keras
- Yahoo Finance API
- Cmoney

## Steps
### Data Acquisition
Using Yahoo! Finance API to retrieve stock price data.

### Data Processing
Processing data using numpy and pandas.

### Model Training
- Training data using LSTM models.
- Normalizing the data.
- Implementing a 4-layer LSTM model for prediction.

### Results & Improvements
- Comparing prediction results with actual data.
- Observing that the LSTM model might not perform well due to possibly unsuitable training data or lack of consideration for other market factors.
- Suggesting improvements by incorporating financial market sentiment analysis and using multiple models.

## Conclusion
Investing involves risks, and there are gains and losses in fund investments. Regardless of the tools used, it is hoped that useful knowledge can be gained from this study.
